===============================

This is the project of Udacity Front End Nanodegree, Arcade Game Clone. All assets were provided and are property of Udacity. 
The project consists of a Frogger like game clone, made with OOP Javascript.
I used vannila JS to make this project and used 4 classes to dray instances on the screen(enemies, player, obstacles and collectibles). The engine was as well provided by Udacity with wich I have made modifications to display infos about the game, like lives score and level.

## The Game 
The difficulty raises as the levels progress. Additional obstacles will appear also to make things harder. Also the enemies(bugs) will increase speed.
