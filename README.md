===============================

This is the project of Udacity Front End Nanodegree, Arcade Game Clone. All assets were provided and are property of Udacity.  
The project consists of a Frogger like game clone, made with OOP Javascript. 
I used vannila JS to make this project and used 4 classes to dray instances on the screen(enemies, player, obstacles and collectibles). The engine was as well provided by Udacity with wich I have made modifications to display infos about the game, like lives score and level.

## The Game 
The difficulty raises as the levels progress. Additional obstacles will appear also to make things harder. Also the enemies(bugs) will increase speed.  
Sometimes, randomly a gem or an extra heart will apear on the board. The rate is 50% for collectibles from which 25% for an extra heart. 

## How to play:
Select a favorite character as the player. Then press Start Game. You ca use either arrow buttons or W A S D for movement.  
Collect gems to gain points. Based on the color they will give different number of points(orange = 70, green = 60, blue = 50). Reching the top(water) will advance a level and gain you 100 points.  
Colliding with and enemy(bug) will loose you a life. When you run out of lives the game ends. Be sure to collect more lifes. You can restart a game by pressing Enter.
